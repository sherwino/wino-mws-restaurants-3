#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

Project Overview

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage Two, you will take the responsive, accessible design you built in [Stage One](https://github.com/sherwino/wino-mws-restaurants) and connect it to an external server. You’ll begin by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. You’ll store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet performance benchmarks, which you’ll test using Lighthouse.

### To Run This Project Locally

1. Clone or Download this repository. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In my case, I had other static file servers available, `serve`, `http-server` but they didn't work so I just stuck with the Python Server. 

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

1. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

1. This site was optimized to be used with a screen reader, so if you browse the site with a tool like ChromVox or the MacOS Voice Assistant you will be able to hear all of the accessibility features built in to the site.
